\section{Likelihood formalism}
\label{sec:likelihoods}

The observables measured in events containing tau lepton pairs 
do not provide sufficient information to fully determine the tau--pair mass, $M_{\tau\tau}$.
Depending on whether the two tau leptons decay hadronically or leptonically, 
the kinematics of the tau--pair decays depends upon $4$--$6$ parameters,
the angles $4$ $\theta_{1}$, $\overline{\phi_{1}}$ and $\theta_{2}$, $\overline{\phi_{2}}$
plus $0$--$2$ masses $\mnus^{1}$ and $\mnus^{2}$,
as described in section~\ref{sec:tau_decay_kinematics}.
This contrasts with only $2$ observables which constrain the momenta of the neutrinos produced in the tau decays:
the two components \METx and \METy of the reconstructed missing transverse momentum, \MET.
%The two \MET components are reconstructed with non--negligible experimental reconstruction,
%amounting to typically $\sigma$\METx$ = \sigma$\METy$ \sim 15$~GeV in the 2011/2012 data--taking period~\cite{DP_12_003,DP_12_013}.

In the SVfit algorithm the fact that the tau decay kinematics is underconstrained by measured observables is handled via a likelihood approach.
The likelihood approach utilized by SVfit allows for a reconstruction of the tau--pair mass on an event--by--event basis.
The term {\em Dynamical Likelihood Methods} (DLM) has been introduced for the application of likelihood methods 
for the purpose of reconstructing kinematic quantities on an event--by--event basis~\cite{Kondo:1988,Kondo:1991}.
$M_{\tau\tau}$ values are reconstructed by combining the measured observables \METx and \METy with a probability model.
The present version of SVfit includes terms for tau decay kinematics and for the \MET resolution~\footnote{
  We foresee to include tau decay vertex information in future versions of the SVfit algorithm.
  The idea of using decay vertex information in the $M_{\tau\tau}$ reconstruction is actually what SVfit owes its name to.
}.
The model makes a prediction for the probability density $p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a})$ 
to observe the values $\vec{x} = (\METx, \METy)$ measured in an event,
given that the unknown parameters specifying the kinematics of the tau--pair decay have values
$\vec{a} = (\theta_{1}, \overline{\phi_{1}}, \theta_{2}, \overline{\phi_{2}}, \mnus^{1}, \mnus^{2})$
and the four--momenta of the visible decay products are $\vec{y} = (p^{vis}_{1}, p^{vis}_{2}$.

Two different methods exist for determining the best estimate for $\vec{a}$, 
given the measured values $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ and a probability density $p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a})$.

In the first method, called {\em marginalization}, a probability 
\begin{equation}
P(M_{\tau\tau}) = \int \delta \left( M_{\tau\tau} - M_{\tau\tau}(\vec{y}, \vec{a} \right) p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a}) d\vec{a}
\end{equation}
is computed.
The integration of the probability densities is performed using the VEGAS~\cite{VEGAS} algorithm by SVfit.
In order to find the best estimate for $M_{\tau\tau}$,
a series of $P(M_{\tau\tau})$ values is
computed for an ascending series of mass hypotheses $M_{\tau\tau}$~\footnote{
  The probabilities $P(M_{\tau\tau})$ are computed in steps in the mass hypothesis.  
  The steps are defined by the recursive relation $\delta M _{i+1} = 1.025 \times \delta M_{i}$, 
  where $\delta M_{0} = 2.5~\GeV$, within the range $M_{\tau\tau} \in [5, 2000]$~\GeV.
}.
The best estimate $\hat{M}_{\tau\tau}$ for the tau--pair mass is taken to be the maximum $M_{\tau\tau}$ value within the series.
Lower (upper) limits on the reconstructed mass $\hat{M}_{\tau\tau}$ are determined for every event
by the $0.16$ ($0.84$) quantiles of the series of mass hypotheses $M_{\tau\tau}^{i}$
and associated probability values $P(M_{\tau\tau}^{i})$.

Alternative to finding $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions by marginalization of the probability densities,
estimates for $M_{\tau\tau}$ may be obtained via the {\em profile likelihood method}.
In the latter,
the best estimate for the tau--pair mass is obtained by maximizing the probability density
$p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a})$ with respect to all parameters $\vec{a}$ which do not correspond to measured observables:
\begin{equation*}
p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \hat{a}) = \max_{\vec{a}} p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a}).
\end{equation*}
The best estimate $\hat{M}_{\tau\tau}$ for the tau--pair mass is then taken to be $\hat{M}_{\tau\tau} = M_{\tau\tau}(\vec{y}, \hat{a})$.
Uncertainties on the reconstructed mass $\hat{M}_{\tau\tau}$ are computed by varying the parameters $\hat{a}$ 
within the region by which the negative logarithm of the probability density $p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a})$ 
increases by $0.5$ units with respect to the best fit value $p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \hat{a})$.

Conceptual complications in using the profile likelihood method in the context of DLM
arise from the fact that probability densities, not probabilities, need to be maximized.
The issue with probability densities is that Jacobian terms $\partial y/\partial y'$ come into existence
in case variables are reparametrized according to $\vec{y} \mapsto \vec{y}' = f(\vec{y})$.
The Jacobian terms are expected to have little effect on the final result in case the likelihood functions are well constrained by the measured observables.
This assumption is not always true when applying likelihood methods to single events.
Besides, the Jacobian terms introduce an undesirable element of arbitrariness.
A second issue of reconstructing kinematic quantities via maximization of likelihood functions
is that estimates of kinematic quantities may be biased.
In case the width of likelihood functions varies as function of the value of the kinematic quantity of interest,
the profile likelihood method gives preference to solutions for which the likelihood functions are narrow and peaked.
In SVfit, we reduce potential biases of this kind by making the widths of likelihood functions
independent of $M_{\tau\tau}$ via suitable reparametrization of the variables $\vec{y}$.
We add a pseudo--Jacobian term of the form $\sin \theta_{1} \cdot \sin \theta_{2} \cdot \log M_{\tau\tau}$ to the likelihood function
in case $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions are computed by the profile likelihood method.
The pseudo--Jacobian term is purely artificial. The motivation to add this term is that we find it to improve the resolution.
The maximization of the likelihood functions is performed using the MINUIT~\cite{MINUIT} package.
The main advantage of reconstructing $M_{\tau\tau}$ via the profile likelihood method
is that MINUIT fits may be substantially less computationally extensive than the numerical integrations performed by VEGAS~\footnote{  
  Computing the $M_{\tau\tau}$ solution for a single event typically takes $1$~s ($10$~ms) 
  in case the solution is obtained via the marginalization (profile likelihood method) on a $2.27$~GHz Intel\TReg~Xeon\TReg~L5520 processor.
}.

The likelihood functions $\cal{L}$ entering the probability density $p(\vec{x} \vert \vec{y}, \vec{a}) = \prod \cal{L}$ 
are described in the following sections.
We consider two different probability models for the tau lepton decay kinematics,
detailed in sections~\ref{sec:psKine} and~\ref{sec:meKine} respectively.
The likelihood term based on \MET is described in section~\ref{sec:likelihoods_met}.


\subsection{Tau decays}
\label{sec:likelihoods_taudecay}

The Cartesian components of the neutrino momenta are re--expressed in terms of variables more
directly connected to the tau decay kinematics. The following parametrization is adopted:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\tau_{\ell}\tau_{\ell}$:\\
the fraction of the tau lepton energy in the laboratory frame taken by the decay leptons
($x_{\ell},x_{\ell}'$), the mass of the two neutrino pairs ($m_{\nu\nu},m_{\nu\nu}'$) and the azimuthal angle of the tau
lepton momenta with respect to their visible decay products ($\phi_{\ell},\phi_{\ell}'$).
By convention, $\phi_{l}=0$ corresponds to a direction in the plane spanned by the the momentum of $\ell$ and the
$z$--axis in the CMS reference frame:
$$
\mathbf{x}_u = \left(x_{\ell}, m_{\nu\nu}, \phi_{\ell}, x_{\ell}', m_{\nu\nu}', \phi_{\ell}'\right)
$$
 \item $\tau_{\ell}\tau_h$:\\
the fraction of the tau lepton energy in the laboratory frame taken by the visible decay particles
($x_{h},x_{\ell}$), the mass of the neutrino pair arising from the fully--leptonic decay ($m_{\nu\nu}$)
and the azimuthal angle of the tau lepton momenta with respect to the direction of their visible decay products
($\phi_{\ell},\phi_{h}$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_u = \left(x_{\ell}, m_{\nu\nu}, \phi_{\ell}, x_{h}, \phi_{h}\right)
$$
 \item $\tau_h\tau_h$:\\
the fraction of the tau lepton energy in the laboratory frame taken by the visible decay particles
($x_{h},x_{h}'$) and the azimuthal angle of the tau
lepton momenta with respect to the direction of their visible decay products ($\phi_{h},\phi_{h}'$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_u = \left(x_{h}, \phi_{h}, x_{h}', \phi_{h}'\right)
$$
\end{itemize}
When complemented with the measured momentum of the decay products and with the reconstructed $\vec{E}_T^{miss}$,
these parameters fully describe the di--tau kinematics.
The di--tau mass is then obtained as a function of these parameters and measurements.
The explicit formula can be straighforward computed but it results quite involved, and therefore it has been omitted
from the text.

An equally good choice of parameters is to replace the $x$ fractions with $\cos\theta^*$, the cosine of the polar
decay angle of the visible decay products ($\ell$, $\pi$, $\rho(\pi\pi)$ or $a_1(\pi\pi\pi)$) in the tau rest frame,
with respect to the polarization axis of the tau, which for a state of definite helicity corresponds to the direction of flight
in the lab frame.
The relation between $x$ and $\cos\theta^*$ can be obtained by solving for the visible energy $E_{vis}$ in the lab frame,
after a Lorentz boost $\gamma=E_{\tau}/m_{\tau}$ from the rest frame:   
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cosTheta}
 \cos\theta^* = \frac{E_{vis} - \gamma E_{vis}^*}{\gamma \beta p_{vis}^*}
\end{equation}
where $E_{vis}^*$ and $p_{vis}^*$ are the energy and momentum of the visible particles in the tau rest frame and
$\beta = \sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2}$. The energy and momentum in the rest frame are given by 
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:mVis}
 E_{vis}^* & = & \frac{m^2_{\tau} + m^2_{vis} - m^2_{\nu\nu}}{2m_{\tau}} \\
 p_{vis}^* & = & \frac{[(m_{\tau}^2-(m_{\nu\nu}+m_{vis})^2)(m_{\tau}^2-(m_{\nu\nu}-m_{vis})^2)]^{\frac{1}{2}}}{2m_{\tau}},
\end{eqnarray}
with $m_{\nu\nu}=0$ for a semi--leptonic decay.
Notice that $-1\leq  \cos\theta^* \leq 1$ implies the physical constraint on $x$: $m_{vis}^2/m_{\tau}^2 \leq x \leq 1$. 
In the collinear limit $\beta \to 1$, Equation \eqref{eq:cosTheta} simplifies to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cosThetaCollHad}
 \cos\theta^* = \frac{2x-1-m^2_{vis}/m^2_{\tau}}{1-m^2_{vis}/m^2_{\tau}}
\end{equation}  
Equation \eqref{eq:cosThetaCollHad} shows that, for a given value of the visible mass $m_{vis}$, the relation between
$x$ and $\cos\theta^*$ is linear.\\

For the fully--leptonic tau decay, an alternative parametrization consists in using the visible lepton energy in the tau rest
frame ($E^*_l$) and $\cos\theta^*$.
Equation \eqref{eq:cosTheta} and \eqref{eq:mVis} can be used to derive the transformation from 
$(E^*_l, \cos\theta^*)$ to $(x_l,m_{\nu\nu})$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:transf}
\begin{cases}
 \cos\theta^* & =  \frac{2x_l}{ 1-\frac{m^2_{\nu\nu}}{m^2_{\tau}} } - 1 \\
  E^*_l       & =  \frac{m_{\tau}}{2}(1-\frac{m^2_{\nu\nu}}{m^2_{\tau}})
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The Jacobian matrix $J$ for the transformation \eqref{eq:transf} is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:transfJac}
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
  \frac{\partial \cos\theta^*}{\partial x_l} &  \frac{\partial \cos\theta^*}{\partial m_{\nu\nu}} \\
  \frac{\partial E^*_l}{\partial x_l}              &  \frac{\partial E^*_l}{\partial m_{\nu\nu}}
\end{array}
\right) =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
  \frac{2}{1-\frac{m^2_{\nu\nu}}{m^2_{\tau}}} & \frac{4x_lm_{\nu\nu}}{ (1-\frac{m^2_{\nu\nu}}{m^2_{\tau}})^2 m_{\tau}^2 } \\
   0 & - \frac{m_{\nu\nu}}{m_{\tau}^2} \\
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation}
with determinant
$$
|J|=\frac{2m_{\nu\nu}}{m_{\tau}^2 - m_{\nu\nu}^2}.
$$ 
In the approximation $m_l\sim0$, the physical region for $(E^*_l, \cos\theta^*)$ is defined by
$-1\leq  \mbox{cos}\theta^* \leq 1$ and $0 \leq E^*_l \leq \frac{m_{\tau}}{2}$, which implies that 
$0\leq x_l \leq 1$ and, for a fixed $x_l$, $0\leq m_{\nu\nu} \leq m_{\tau}\sqrt{1-x_l}$.

\subsubsection{Phase--space model}
\label{sec:psKine} 

A simplified decay width for the semileptonic decays (phase--space), valid for unpolarized taus ($P_{\tau}=0$),
consists in assuming an uniform probability density:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hadDecayPS}
\frac{d\Gamma}{dx_h} = \frac{1}{1- \frac{m^2_{vis}}{m^2_{\tau}}},
\end{equation}
where $m_{vis}$ is the measured visible $\tau_h$ mass. This simple formula
already provides a good description of the hadronic decay widths.


\subsubsection{Matrix element model}
\label{sec:meKine}

In terms of the parameters described in Sec. \ref{sec:decayParam}, the probability density functions for the decay
$\tau^-\to \ell^- \: \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \: \nu_{\tau}$, with a tau polarization $P_{\tau}=\pm1$, is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lepDecay}
\frac{d\Gamma}{dx_{\ell}dm_{\nu\nu}} \sim \frac{m_{\nu\nu}}{4m_{\tau}^2} [(m_{\tau}^2 +2m_{\nu\nu}^2 )(m_{\tau}^2 - m_{\nu\nu}^2) +
P_{\tau}(m_{\tau}^2(2x_{\ell} -1) + m_{\nu\nu}^2)(-m_{\tau}^2+2m_{\nu\nu}^2)  ],
\end{equation}
which has been obtained from Ref. \cite{TauPol} using the transformation \eqref{eq:transf}.
The distributions for the two polarization states are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2DCorrLep}
in the form of a density plot in the $(x_{\ell},m_{\nu\nu})$ plane.

in $\tau^-_{L,R}\to \ell \: 3\nu$ decays (obtained from Eq. \eqref{eq:lepDecay})}
\label{fig:2DCorrLep}
\end{figure}

For the one prong decay $\tau^-\to \pi^- \: \nu_{\tau}$, with tau polarization $P_{\tau}=\pm1$,
the decay width differential in the pion $x_h$ fraction is given by \cite{TauPol}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hadDecay}
\frac{d\Gamma}{dx_h} = 1 + P_{\tau}(2x_h-1) 
\end{equation}
For the other hadronic decays, the formalism gets more involved due to the presence of spin one particles,
for which, in addition, the finite decay width has to be taken into account \cite{TauPol}.
By performing a numerical integration over the vector meson line shape parametrized as in Ref. \cite{TauPol}, the distributions
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hVectors} are obtained.

The decay widths are separately computed for longitudinally ($L$) or transversely polarized ($T$) vector mesons.
The results are reported in Fig. \ref{fig:hVectors} for the $\tau^-\to \rho^- \: \nu_{\tau}$ decay and
in Fig. \ref{fig:hVectors2} for the $\tau^-\to a_1 \: \nu_{\tau}$ decay.

\label{fig:hVectors2}
\end{figure}

As seen in the plots, there is a strong correlation between $P_{\tau}$ and $\langle x_h \rangle$, namely
the left--handed polarized tau ($\tau^-_L$) tends to decay into a hard transversely--polarized $\rho^-$ or $a^-_1$,
which in turn prefers to share its lab energy uniformly among the daughter pions.
Conversely, a right--handed polarized tau ($\tau^-_R$) tends to decay into a hard longitudinally--polarized meson,
for which the distinguishable pion (i.e. the pion with the same charge of the mother tau)
is more likely to be soft, if the other pion(s) are 
hard, or the other way round. Therefore, if the tau polarization were known and if it were possbile to distinguish
the single pions inside $\tau_h$, the tau kinematics would be better constrained.

Even though $P_{\tau}$ is not measurable, the spin of the mother resonance imposes a selection rule
on the polarization states of the two tau leptons, namely only $RL$ or $LR$ combinations are allowed for a spin--one resonance
(e.g. the $Z$ boson), only $RR$ or $LL$ are possible for a spin--0 (e.g. the Higgs boson).    

Let's assume that the individual pions can be resolved inside the hadronically--decaying tau, and let's define $z$ to be 
the fraction of energy of the visible decay particles in the lab frame taken by the distinguishable pion:
$z\equiv E_{\pi}/E_{vis}$. For the $\rho^- \to \pi^- \pi^0$ decay, the probability density function are given by \cite{TauPol}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dZrho}
\begin{cases}
\frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_L)}{dz} & =  3(2z-1)^2 \\
\frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_T)}{dz} & =  6z(1-z) \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq:dZrho}, the \textit{conditional} probability to observe $x_h$ given $z$ is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rhoCondZ}
\frac{d\Gamma}{dx_h}(x_h|z) = \frac{\frac{d\Gamma_L}{dx_h}(x_h) \cdot \frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_L)}{dz} + \frac{d\Gamma_T}{dx_h}(x_h) \cdot \frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_T)}{dz}}
{M_L \frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_L)}{dz} + M_T \frac{d\Gamma(\rho^-_T)}{dz}}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\alpha}=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{d\Gamma_{\alpha}}{dx_h'}(x_h')dx_h'$.

A similar formula exists for the $a_1^-$ decay. It is useful to distinguish the case where the three pions
are individually resolved from the case where the the undistinguishable pions cannot be resolved.
In the former case, the ideal polarimeter to be used to condition the decay width is provided by the 
$\cos\psi$ variable introduced by Ref. \cite{TauPol3}:
\begin{equation}
 \cos\psi \equiv \frac{8m_{\tau}^2 \vec{p}_1\cdot(\vec{p}_2 \times \vec{p}_3)/|\vec{p}_1+\vec{p}_2+\vec{p}_3|}
{\sqrt{-\lambda(\lambda(m_{\tau}^2,m_{12}^2,m_{\pi}^2)\lambda(m_{\tau}^2,m_{13}^2,m_{\pi}^2)\lambda(m_{\tau}^2,m_{23}^2),m_{\pi}^2}}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-2xy-2yz-2zx$.
If the undistinguishable pions are not individually resolved, one needs to integrate them out.
To do so, a numerical intergration of Eq. (46) and (47) from Ref. \cite{TauPol2}
has been performed to obtain $d\Gamma(a_{1\; \alpha}^-)/dz$.
The resulting distributions are reported in Fig. \ref{fig:hzA1}.\\

\subsection{Missing $E_{T}$}
\label{sec:likelihoods_met}

The \MET likelihood quantifies the compatibility of a tau decay hypothesis
with the missing transverse momentum reconstructed in an event.
Assuming that the neutrinos produced in tau decays are the only source of \MET,
momentum conservation in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis implies that
the vectorial sum of neutrino momenta matches the reconstructed \MET~\footnote{
  Energy and momentum conservation in longitudinal direction cannot be used to constrain the momenta
  of the neutrinos produced in tau decays, as remnants of the colliding protons
  carry away an unknown amount of energy and longitudinal momentum.
}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum p_{x}^{\nu} & = & \METx = -\sum p_{x}^{rec} \\
\sum p_{y}^{\nu} & = & \METy = -\sum p_{y}^{rec}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The sums on the right extend over all particles reconstructed by the particle--flow (PF) algorithm~\cite{PFT-09-001}.

Differences between $\sum p_{x}^{\nu}$ and $\METx$ ($\sum p_{y}^{\nu}$ and $\METy$) 
may arise due to resolution effects and are accounted for in the probability model, assuming a Gaussian resolution.
The logarithm of the \MET likelihood, $\log \cal{L}$, is computed based on the residual between the sum of neutrino momenta
for a given tau decay hypothesis and the value of \MET in the event, reconstructed using the PF algorithm:
\begin{equation}
\log \cal{L}_{MET} = \frac{1}{2}
 \left( \begin{array}{c} \mbox{\METx} - \sum p_{x}^{\nu} \\ \mbox{\METy} - \sum p_{y}^{\nu} \end{array} \right)^{T}
\cdot V^{-1} \cdot
 \left( \begin{array}{c} \mbox{\METx} - \sum p_{x}^{\nu} \\ \mbox{\METy} - \sum p_{y}^{\nu} \end{array} \right).
\end{equation}
The expected resolution of the \MET reconstruction is represented by the covariance matrix $V$ 
and is estimated on an event--by--event basis by the \MET--significance algorithm~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.
%Typical resolutions on the two components \METx and \METy 
%in the 2011/2012 data--taking period are $\sigma\METx = \sigma\METy \sim 15$~GeV~\cite{DP_12_003,DP_12_013}.
