\section{Tau decay kinematics}
\label{sec:tau_decay_kinematics}

In order to reconstruct the mass of a tau lepton pair,
one needs to know the four--momenta of both tau leptons.
The kinematics of each tau decay is fully determined by two four--momenta:
the sum of all visible tau decay products and the sum of all invisible particles produced in the tau decays.
The energy, polar and azimuthal angle and the mass of visible decay products is measured with small uncertainties.
The main experimental challenge is to reconstruct the four--momenta of the invisible particles.

One (two) neutrinos are produced in hadronic (leptonic) hadronic tau decays.
Consequently, the system of invisible decay products is massless in case of hadronic tau decays,
while the invisible momentum system produced in leptonic tau decays is in general of non--zero mass.
The momentum sum of all visible plus invisible decay products is constrained by the condition that it matches $m_{\tau}$,
the tau lepton mass.

The kinematics of hadronic (leptonic) tau decays can hence be parametrized by two (three) variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta$ \\
The ``opening--angle'' $\theta$ is defined as the angle between the boost
direction of the tau lepton and the momentum vector of the visible decay
products in the rest frame of the tau. 
\item $\overline{\phi}$ \\
The azimuthal angle of the tau in the
CMS detector (``laboratory'') frame is denoted as $\overline{\phi}$~\footnote{
  We denote quantities defined in the laboratory frame by a overline.
}.
A local coordinate system is defined such that the $\bar{z}$--direction lies along the visible momentum 
and $\overline{\phi} = 0$ lies in the plane spanned by the momentum vector of the visible decay products and
the proton beam direction. 
\item $\mnus$ \\
The third parameter, $\mnus$, is specific to leptonic tau decays.
It denotes the invariant mass of the invisible momentum system.
\end{itemize}

Given $\theta$, $\overline{\phi}$ and $\mnus$, the energy and direction of the
tau lepton can be computed by means of the following equations: 
Energy and momentum of the visible decay products in the rest frame of the tau lepton are related to the
invariant mass of the neutrino system by:
\begin{equation}
E^{vis} = \frac{m_\tau^2 + \mvis^2 - \mnus^2}{2m_\tau}, \qquad p^{vis} = \sqrt{\left(E^{vis}\right)^{2} - m_{vis}^{2}}
\label{eq:restFrameMomentumRelation}
\end{equation}
Relation~\ref{eq:restFrameMomentumRelation} is valid for hadronic as well as for leptonic tau decays:
In case of hadronic tau decays the variable $\mnus$ is a constant of value zero.

The opening angle $\overline{\theta}$ between the tau lepton direction and the
visible momentum vector in the laboratory frame is determined by the rest frame
quantities via the (Lorentz invariant) component of the visible momentum
perpendicular to the tau lepton direction:
\begin{align}
p^{vis}_{\perp} &= \overline p^{vis}_{\perp} \nonumber \\
\Rightarrow \sin \overline \theta &= \frac{p^{vis} \sin \theta}{\overline p^{vis}} 
\label{eq:labFrameOpeningAngle} 
\end{align}

The energy of the tau lepton in the laboratory frame is obtained using the relation $\overline{E}_{\tau} = \gamma m_{\tau}$
by solving for the boost factor $\gamma$ in
the Lorentz transformation which relates the visible momentum component parallel to the tau direction
in the tau rest frame and the laboratory frame:
\begin{align}
\overline{p}^{vis} \cos \overline{\theta} &= \gamma \beta E^{vis} + \gamma p^{vis} \cos\theta \nonumber \\ 
\Rightarrow \gamma &= \frac{E^{vis}[{\left( E^{vis} \right)^2 + \left( \overline{p}^{vis} \cos \overline{\theta} \right)^2 
 - \left( p^{vis} \cos \theta \right)^2}]^{1/2} - p^{vis} \cos \theta \overline{p}^{vis} \cos \overline{\theta}}{\left( E^{vis} \right)^2 
 - \left( p^{vis} \cos \theta \right)^2}, \nonumber 
%\label{eq:LorentzRelationship}
\end{align}
with $E^{vis}$ and $p^{vis}$ given by equation~\ref{eq:restFrameMomentumRelation} and $\overline{\theta}$ by equation~\ref{eq:labFrameOpeningAngle} respectively.

The energy of the tau lepton in the laboratory frame,
expressed as function of the measured visible momentum $\overline{p}^{vis}$,
depends on two of the three parameters only: 
on the rest frame opening angle $\theta$ and on the invariant mass $\mnus$ of the neutrino system.
The direction of the tau lepton momentum vector lies on the surface of a cone of
opening angle $\overline{\theta}$ (given by equation~\ref{eq:labFrameOpeningAngle}),
the axis of which is given by the visible momentum vector.  
The direction of the tau lepton four--vector $p_{\tau}$ is specified by the addition of the third parameter
$\overline{\phi}$, the third parameter, which gives the azimuthal angle of the tau lepton with respect
to the visible momentum vector.  
The relation between $p_{\tau}$ and $p^{vis}$, $\overline{\theta}$, $\overline{\phi}$
is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:svFitDecayParDiagram}.

For comparison with the literature~\cite{TauPol,TauPol2} 
it is useful to derrive an alternative parametrization of the tau decay kinematics,
using the fraction of energy carried by the visible decay products (in the laboratory frame)
\begin{}
X = \frac{\overline{E}^{vis}}{\overline{E}_{\tau}}
\end{equation}
instead of the angle $\theta$.
The relation between $X$ and $\theta$ is obtained by solving for the visible energy...
