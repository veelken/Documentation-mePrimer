\section{SVfit performance in $WH$ events}
\label{sec:appendix_performance_WH}

In this section we study the performance of the SVfit algorithm to reconstruct the tau--pair mass 
in events in which a Standard Model Higgs is produced in association with a $W$ boson.
The events are analyzed in the channel in which the Higgs boson decays into tau leptons
which decay hadronically
and the $W$ boson decays into muon plus neutrino,
$WH \rightarrow \mu \nu \tau \tau \rightarrow \mu \nu \tau_{had} \tau_{had}$.

The neutrino produced in the $W$ boson decay modifies the \MET balance ({\it cf.}\ equation~\ref{eq:met_balance})
and needs to be accounted for in the likelihood model used to reconstruct $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions.
We model the $W$ decay by introducing $3$ additional parameters to the likelihood model described in section~\ref{sec:likelihoods}:
the decay angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ which describe the direction of the charged lepton in the rest frame of the $W$ boson
plus $M_{\ell\nu}$, the invariant mass of charged lepton plus neutrino produced in the $W$ decay~\footnote{
  Note that no modifications are necessary to the likelihood model described in section~\ref{sec:likelihoods} in case 
  $WH$ events are analyzed in the decay channel in which the $W$ boson decays into pairs of jets, $WH \rightarrow j j \tau \tau$,
  or in $ZH$ events in which the $Z$ boson decays into a pair of electrons or muons, $ZH \rightarrow \ell \ell \tau \tau$,
  as the \MET balance is not affected by the $W$ and $Z$ decays in these cases.
}.

The likelihood functions for tau decay kinematics and the missing $E_{T}$ are augmented by terms modeling the $W$ decay kinematics and the $W$ line shape.
The $W$ bosons are assumed to be unpolarized.
In this case the $W$ decay is isotropic and the likelihood function modeling the $W$ decay kinematics is constant:
\begin{equation*}
p_{W}^{DK} = \frac{1}{4\pi}.
\end{equation*}
The $W$ line shape is described by a relativistic Breit--Wigner function~\cite{relativisticBreitWigner}:
\begin{equation*}
p_{W}^{LS} = \frac{k}{(M_{\mu\nu}^{2} - M_{W}^{2}) + M_{W}^{2} \Gamma_{W}^2}, 
  \mbox{ with } 
k = \frac{2 \sqrt{2} M_{W} \Gamma_{W} \gamma}{\pi \sqrt{M_{W}^{2} + \gamma}}, \gamma = \sqrt{M_{W}^{2} (M_{W}^{2} + \Gamma_{W}^{2})}
\end{equation*}

The three additional parameters describing the $W$ decay (the two $W$ specific additions to the likelihood function)
are handled by the marginalization and profile likelihood methods in the same way as the parameters describing the tau decay kinematics
(the likelihood functions for tau decay kinematics and missing $E_{T}$).
The \MET balance of equation~\ref{eq:met_balance} is extended to include the neutrino produced in the $W$ boson decay on the left hand side of the equation.

The $M_{\tau\tau}$ distributions reconstructed by SVfit in $WH$ events simulated for a Higgs mass $M = 120$~\GeV
and in simulated $ZH$ events
are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:perfCompPSvsMEkine_WH_ditau} and~\ref{fig:perfCompFitvsInt_WH_ditau}.
The distributions compare different likelihood models for the tau decay kinematics 
and $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions obtained by marginalization versus profile likelihood method.
The shape of the distributions is similar to the shape of $M_{\tau\tau}$ distributions reconstructed in 
$Z \rightarrow \tau \tau$ and $M = 130$~\GeV Higgs $\rightarrow \tau \tau$ events 
without additional $W$ bosons ({\it cf.}\ Figs.~\ref{fig:perfCompPSvsMEkine_ditau} and~\ref{fig:perfCompFitvsInt_ditau}).
The presence of an additional neutrino from the $W$ decay degrades the resolution by a bit, but not by much.
In summary, Figs.~\ref{fig:perfCompPSvsMEkine_WH_ditau} and~\ref{fig:perfCompFitvsInt_WH_ditau}
demonstrate the flexibility of the likelihood approach implemented in SVfit to perform well in different use--cases.
