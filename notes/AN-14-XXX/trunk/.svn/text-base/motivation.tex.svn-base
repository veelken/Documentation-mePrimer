\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Decays of neutral particles into tau pairs are an important experimental signature at the LHC.
The main focus at present is certainly on the search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson~\cite{HIG-12-028}.
The analysis of Higgs decays into tau pairs will provide information whether the boson found around $125$~GeV is indeed the SM Higgs boson,
or another particle, e.g. one of the neutral Higgs bosons predicted for supersymmetric extensions of the SM~\cite{HIG-12-018}.
The search for Higgs bosons is not the only motivation to study events containing tau pairs though.
Several scenarios for physics beyond the SM predict an enhanced production of taus~\cite{PTDR1,PTDR2}.
An example of such a search is the decay of heavy neutral gauge bosons via $Z' \rightarrow \tau^{+} \tau^{-}$~\cite{EXO-11-031}.

A common feature of such searches is that a possible signal would manifest itself as an excess of events 
containing pairs of oppositely charged taus compared to the SM expectation.
The sensitivity of analyses searching for these signals is enhanced significantly
by analyzing the distribution of the tau--pair mass in selected events,
rather than performing simple counting experiments.

In this note, we present improvements to the likelihood based algorithm, {\em SVfit}~\cite{AN-11-165},
which has been used in previous $H \rightarrow \tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ searches performed by CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011nx,Chatrchyan:2012vp}.
The improved version described in this note is used in the most recent analysis update~\cite{HIG-12-018}.

The note is organized as follows:
In section~\ref{sec:tau_decay_kinematics} we detail the kinematics of tau decays.
The likelihood formalism on which our algorithm is based is introduced in section~\ref{sec:likelihoods}.
The recent SVfit improvements are described in this section.
In section~\ref{sec:performance} we present the performance of the improved algorithm.
We conclude the note with a summary in section~\ref{sec:summary}.
The application of SVfit to reconstruct tau--pair masses in $WH \rightarrow \ell\nu \tau\tau$ events
is described in section~\ref{sec:appendix_performance_WH} of the appendix.
