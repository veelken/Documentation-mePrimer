\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Improvements to the SVfit algorithm for tau--pair mass reconstruction have been described in this note.
The main developments with respect to the previous version of SVfit
are the implementation of likelihood functions for leptonic and hadronic tau decays that are based on full matrix elements 
plus the option to compute $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions by marginalization.
We find that distributions of $M_{\tau\tau}$ reconstructed using the matrix element based likelihood functions 
are similar to the distributions reconstructed using the phase--space model for tau decay kinematics.
The marginalization of likelihood functions for computing $M_{\tau\tau}$ solutions 
is found to provide a significant improvement in performance compared to the previously used profile likelihood method.

In applications of SVfit, we recommend to use the matrix element based likelihood function for leptonic tau decays.
For hadronic tau decays we recommend to keep using the phase--space model.
Concerning the choice between marginalization and profile likelihood method,
our recommendation is to use the marginalization method in all applications 
for which a computing time of $1$~s per event is permissible.

The $M_{\tau\tau}$ distributions reconstructed in $WH$ events
demonstrate that the SVfit likelihood approach for tau--pair mass reconstruction 
is flexible enough to adapt to different use--cases.
