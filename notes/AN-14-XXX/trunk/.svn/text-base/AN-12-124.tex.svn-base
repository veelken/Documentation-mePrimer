% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
  This note documents recent developments and improvements of SVfit,
  a novel algorithm for the reconstruction of resonances decaying to taus.
  The resolution attained by SVfit for reconstructing the tau pair mass
  is studied over a broad range of missing $E_{T}$ resolutions,
  allowing to assess the SVfit performance in future pile--up conditions.
  The flexibility of using a likelihood approach for reconstructing resonances decaying to tau pairs
  is demonstrated by applying the SVfit technique to $WH \rightarrow \mu \nu \tau \tau$ events.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text (no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).

%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
